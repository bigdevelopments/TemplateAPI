# Template API - Starting point for a service
This is a very simple and somewhat pointless service based on the .NET6 minimal API approach, offered
as a starting point for real services for fleshing out. Just shows DI bootstrapping and returns JSON
either as a string or by serialising model objects. No thought given to authentication yet.
